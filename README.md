# Oi! Don't look down!

We seem to live in a world where we're always on our smartphones... we touch our phones an average of 2,617 times a day. Perhaps it's time to stop looking down and get off our smartphones for a change and see what we're missing out on when we're looking down.

This was a group project, working with Aidan, Cal and Alex, we had to create a small project that utilises `<video>` and `<audio>` elements.
